cost = num of errors/ num of total predictions

low cost = good model, high cost = bad model

(2 _ 1) + ( 3 _ 5 ) + ( 2 \* 2 )

=> [ 2 3 2 ] \* [ 1 5 2 ] ""dot product""

this is where you mutiplie by the element number

so it will be 2 _ 1 and the rest would be [3 2] _ [5 2]

and then that 2\*1 would be saved and later be summed up after both vectors are empty

note: can't dot prodcut two vectors if they have different lengths.

Matrices are more complicated. They are 2-dimensional, and can have many rows and columns. Here is an example of a matrix:
