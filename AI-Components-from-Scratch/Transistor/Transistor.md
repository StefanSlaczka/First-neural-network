The Transistor layer is the fundamental computinoal unit of all neural networks. This is because data is processed and trandoemed from one represnetaion to anouther.


So each neuron prefroms a small mathematical operation.

1. weightted sum: We multiply each input feature by its weight "the neuron's internal parameters" Then we add a bias term to slightly shift the ouput.

   **z**=**∑**(**in**p**u**t**i****×**w**e**i**g**h**t**i****)**+**bia**s**
2. Then we pass the sum into a non-linear funtion. That gives the neuron the ablity to model non linear relaships. This is needed to understand complex languages and comcepts.

   output = activation(z)
3. Output: We gain the output a single value. It is a transformed version of the input that encodes some kind of feature importance or sematic meaning.

Think of a Neuron like a filter

* The *weights* determine what patterns it pays attention to.
* The *activation* decides how strongly it reacts.
* The *bias* lets it “shift” its decision boundary.


When you combine  **many neurons** , you form a  **layer** , which can detect higher-level patterns — like moving from recognizing “cat” and “sat” to understanding the *relationship* between them.

### **Test Case: Using Transistor Layer with Word Features**

You already have feature vectors from your  **Attention Mechanism** , e.g.:

| Word | Vector (noun, verb) |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| The  | [0.1, 0.1]          |
| Cat  | [0.6, 0.2]          |
| Sat  | [0.2, 0.6]          |

**Process:**

1. Each vector is passed into the neuron (transistor).
2. The neuron multiplies by its weights and applies the activation.
3. Outputs represent how “strongly” that neuron fires for each word.

### **Expected Output**

* Words with stronger **noun/verb activations** will produce higher outputs.
* Common filler words (like “the” or “on”) will have near-zero activation.
* This simulates the neuron “focusing” on meaningful words — similar to how biological neurons fire only when something important happens.
